This is just some test code I was kicking around. I stumbled across it and decided to 
put it somewhere that I'm likely to see it and pick it up again. 

The idea is to make it relatively quick and easy to develop new AMQP message 
processors. It uses the pika asynchronous AMQP client, and the Tornado ioloop.
